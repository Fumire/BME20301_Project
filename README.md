## Scripts

### reader.py

This python script changes the FASTA files to python dictionary object. 

#### Function `cut_it()`

#### Function `Read()`

The function Read() gets two parameters: `file_name` and `full_name`. 

### alignment.py

This python script finds the local and global alignment among the two DNA or amino acid sequences. 

#### Function `open_blosum()`

#### Function `solve_map_global()` & `solve_map_local()`

#### Class `Alignment`

#### Function `find_alignment_global()` & `find_alignment_local()` in Class `Alignment`
